## Instructions

To run the code you need to install  [Tubex](http://simon-rohou.fr/research/tubex-lib/doc/index.html) for solving interval tubes and the graphical tool  [VIbes](http://simon-rohou.fr/research/tubex-lib/doc/install/01-installation.html#graphical-tools) viewer.  To do so, see the instructions [here](https://github.com/jad-rabehi/Constraint-programming#instructions).
